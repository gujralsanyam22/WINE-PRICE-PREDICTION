## Overview
Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.  Description Context The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).  These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). 
This dataset is also available from the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality , I just shared it to kaggle for convenience. (If I am mistaken and the public license type disallowed me from doing so, I will take this down if requested.)  Content For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009]. Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 1 - fixed acidity 2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid 4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides 6 - free sulfur dioxide 7 - total sulfur dioxide 8 - density 9 - pH 10 - sulphates 11 - alcohol Output variable (based on sensory data): 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10).


## Motivation
What could be a perfect way to utilize unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of you, I spend my time in cooking, Netflix, coding and reading some latest research papers on weekends. The idea of classifying indian currency struck to me when I was browsing through some research papers. I couldn't find any relevant research paper (and of course dataset!) associated with it. And that led me to collect the images of Indian currency to train a deep learning model using [this](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download) amazing tool.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two part:
1. Training a deep learning model using Keras. (_Not covered in this repo. I'll update the link here once I make it public._)
2. Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku.
    - A user can choose image from a device or capture it using a pre-built camera.
    - Used __Amazon S3 Bucket__ to store the uploaded image and predictions.
    - Used __CSRF Token__ to protect against CSRF attacks.
    - Used __Sentry__ to catch the exception on the back-end.
    - After uploading the image, the predictions are displayed on a __Bar Chart__.
    ## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
> STEP 1
#### Linux and macOS User
Open `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file and add the following credentials:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_KEY="your_aws_secret_key"
export ICP_BUCKET='your_aws_bucket_name'
export ICP_BUCKET_REGION='bucket_region'
export ICP_UPLOAD_DIR='bucket_path_to_save_images'
export ICP_PRED_DIR='bucket_path_to_save_predictions'
export ICP_FLASK_SECRET_KEY='anything_random_but_unique'
export SENTRY_INIT='URL_given_by_sentry'
```
Note: __SENTRY_INIT__ is optional, only if you want to catch exceptions in the app, else comment/remove the dependencies and code associated with sentry in `app/main.py`

#### Windows User
Since, I don't have a system with Windows OS, here I collected some helpful resource on adding User Environment Variables in Windows.

__Attention__: Please perform the steps given in these tutorials at your own risk. Please don't mess up with the System Variables. It can potentially damage your PC. __You should know what you're doing__.

> STEP 2

To run the app in a local machine, shoot this command in the project directory:
```bash
gunicorn wsgi:app
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Set the environment variable on Heroku as mentioned in _STEP 1_ in the __Run__ section. [[Reference](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)]

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

## To Do
1. Convert the app to run without any internet connection, i.e. __PWA__.
2. Add a better vizualization chart to display the predictions.

## Bug / Feature Request
If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an issue [here](https://github.com/rowhitswami/Indian-Currency-Prediction/issues/new) by including your search query and the expected result.

If you'd like to request a new function, feel free to do so by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/rowhitswami/Indian-Currency-Prediction/issues/new). Please include sample queries and their corresponding results.

## Credits
This project wouldn't have been possible without this tool. It saved my enormous amount of time while collecting the data. A huge shout-out to its creator.
